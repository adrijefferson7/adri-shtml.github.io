			The reason Odell is so good at one-handed snags is because of his hairstyle. It is his source of power. I have a swaggin' hairstyle, but it is not the kind I need if I want to make one-handed catches. Because I want to be like Odell, but better, I need to change my hairstyle. I will miss the hair I have now, but it is a necessary sacrifice for the sake of my sport. Get ready to see the brand new me. Football is a big part of my life. i watch Odell beckham he also is good at dancing
